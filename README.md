# Ignite Teams

A application to help organize people who get together to play in groups. 

## Description

The proposal to help organize people who get together to play in groups. 
It is an application with navigation in stacks where it is possible to register/remove classes/team members and store this information in the local storage of the device, preserving the data even if the app is closed. 
We'll follow a style guide to implement our theme in Styled Components to maintain a standard throughout the app.
